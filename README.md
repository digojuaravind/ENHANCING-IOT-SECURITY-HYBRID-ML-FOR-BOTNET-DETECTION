# ENHANCING-IOT-SECURITY-HYBRID-ML-FOR-BOTNET-DETECTION

### üìÑ Project Description

With the exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the risk of cyberattacks has significantly increased, making IoT networks a prime target for malicious actors. Among these, **botnet attacks** stand out as one of the most devastating and challenging threats to network security. Botnets are networks of compromised devices controlled by cybercriminals to launch large-scale attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), data breaches, and malware propagation.

Traditional security mechanisms like **signature-based detection** and **rule-based intrusion detection systems** struggle to detect botnets effectively due to the evolving nature of attack vectors, polymorphic malware, and sophisticated evasion techniques. This project proposes an advanced solution to these challenges by developing a **Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Botnet Detection in IoT environments**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Objective

The primary objective of this project is to enhance botnet detection in IoT networks using a **hybrid deep learning framework**, named **ACLR**, which combines:

* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**

By leveraging the individual strengths of these architectures, the proposed model is designed to accurately detect and classify botnet attacks by analyzing complex patterns in network traffic data.

### üß™ Methodology

* **Dataset Used:** The **UNSW-NB15** dataset, which includes a wide range of attack types such as DoS, Exploits, Backdoor, Fuzzers, Generic, Reconnaissance, Analysis, Shellcode, and Worms.

* **Model Architecture:** A stacking ensemble model (ACLR) is constructed by integrating ANN, CNN, LSTM, and RNN layers to capture spatial, sequential, and temporal features from the network data.

* **Performance Metrics Evaluated:**

  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision-Recall Area Under Curve (PR-AUC)**
  * **Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC)**
  * **K-fold Cross-Validation Accuracy (k = 3, 5, 7, 10)**

* **Comparative Analysis:** The proposed ACLR model‚Äôs performance is compared against standalone deep learning models and state-of-the-art techniques to validate its effectiveness.

### üìä Results

* **Testing Accuracy:** 96.98%
* **K-Fold Cross-Validation Accuracy (k = 5):** 97.49%
* **ROC-AUC Score:** 0.9934
* **PR-AUC Score:** 0.9950

These results demonstrate the model's superior capability in detecting botnet activities with high precision and generalizability across various network conditions.

### üöÄ Significance & Impact

The proposed ACLR hybrid model contributes to the domain of **IoT cybersecurity** by providing a robust and scalable solution for botnet attack detection. Its high accuracy and reliability make it suitable for deployment in real-world, resource-constrained IoT environments.

Key benefits include:

* Improved automated threat detection
* Reduced response time to cyber incidents
* Enhanced network security resilience
* Adaptability to evolving cyber threats

This project serves as a valuable tool for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and organizations looking to strengthen their defense mechanisms against botnet attacks and other emerging cyber threats.
