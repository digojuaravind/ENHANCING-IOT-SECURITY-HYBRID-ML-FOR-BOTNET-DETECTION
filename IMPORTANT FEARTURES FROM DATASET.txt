Feature | Reason for Importance
dur (Duration) | Attack flows may be shorter or significantly longer than normal flows.
sbytes / dbytes (Source/Destination Bytes) | Abnormal byte volumes can indicate data exfiltration or DoS attacks.
rate | Unusual packet rates often signal scanning or flooding attacks.
sload / dload | High traffic load in either direction can be an indicator of anomalies.
sloss / dloss | Packet loss often accompanies DDoS or network congestion due to attacks.
sinpkt / dinpkt | Packet inter-arrival times can help spot slowloris or low-rate attacks.
sjit / djit | Packet jitter reveals inconsistencies that can be due to attack behavior.
sttl / dttl | TTL values can help detect spoofing or path manipulation.
smean / dmean | Mean packet sizes are often consistent for legitimate traffic but vary during attacks.
tcprtt / synack / ackdat | TCP timing and handshake anomalies often reveal scanning or SYN flood attacks.
ct_state_ttl | Useful for identifying unusual or suspicious state transitions.
